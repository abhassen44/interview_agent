      "question": "Given your experience developing the \"Smart Irrigation System\" using ESP32 and a NodeMCU, can you describe a specific challenge you encountered in integrating the sensor data acquisition (e.g., soil moisture, temperature) from the ESP32 with the control logic implemented on the NodeMCU, and how you overcame it?",
      "user_answer": "yes",
      "ideal_answer": "A strong answer would describe a specific challenge encountered during the integration of sensor data from the ESP32 to the NodeMCU in the Smart Irrigation System.  This could include issues like: data format incompatibility (e.g., different data types or units), communication protocol challenges (e.g., difficulty establishing reliable communication over WiFi or serial), data loss or corruption during transmission, or discrepancies in timing between sensor readings and control actions. The answer should then detail the steps taken to overcome the challenge,  providing specific technical details such as: the chosen communication protocol (e.g., MQTT, HTTP, serial),  the data serialization format (e.g., JSON, CSV), error handling strategies implemented,  and debugging techniques used.  Finally, a good answer would quantify the success of the solution (e.g., improved data reliability, reduced latency). For example, a candidate could explain how they dealt with inconsistent soil moisture readings by implementing a moving average filter and a threshold-based outlier rejection system, or how they used MQTT to achieve reliable and asynchronous communication between the two devices, highlighting the advantages of this choice over alternatives.",

      "feedback": "The candidate's response is completely inadequate.  A simple 'yes' provides no information about the technical challenge, the solution, or any relevant details.  While the communication score is given a 1 for attempting to answer the question, the lack of substance means the technical accuracy, depth of knowledge, and practical application are all 0. The candidate needs to demonstrate a concrete understanding of the integration process and problem-solving skills related to embedded systems development."
